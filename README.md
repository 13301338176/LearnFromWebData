# LearnFromWebData
Code used in the paper "Learning to Learn from Web Data through Deep Semantic Embeddings" ECCV 2018 MULA Workshop

A blog post explaining the work is available [here](https://gombru.github.io/2018/08/01/learning_from_web_data/).

- The code in the folders named with a text embedding name is to train text models and compute the text embeddings with them.

- The code in googlenet_regression folder trains a CNN (PyCaffe) to regress those text embeddings from images.

Read the paper or the blog post for more details.
